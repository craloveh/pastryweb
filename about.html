<p>The purpose of creating this site is to present the Fast Food Restaurant “La famille Pâtisserie” This restaurant was born by our eldest daughter, after having tasted her mother's cake and pâtés on a Sunday afternoon. She said dad why not start a restaurant because grandma cooks well. So the Dad asked his daughter what name could we give to the restaurant so she replied “The Pastisseriez family” since it is the whole family who will work to offer a quality and local service to our community.
Tomorrow is your wedding anniversary! Next month is your first child's birthday! Then your partner… Are you pressed for time? You do not know what to do ? Do you want to mark those dates that are dear to you? So don't worry, the patisserie family is here to serve you anytime you want one cake, 2 cakes or more. The pastry family is a pastry house specializing in the production of the following items:
</p>
- Cakes
- Pasta
-	Some croissants
- Pizza,
- Cookies
- Royal braids
- Pies
- Cornets
-	Etc.
<p>
Leave the preparation of your parts to us, and we will deliver them to your home without any hassle. Because the holiday is celebrated with family!
</p>

<p>
The party is a family party! From now on with “the pastry family” you will no longer have any headaches when preparing your birthday parties (births, weddings) and for all other special occasions (engagements and family receptions).
